[STEP 3 ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL & TAXONOMY (ENHANCED)]

!!! ANALYST INSTRUCTION !!!
This document provides an Analytical Framework for interpreting social media phenomena and extracting sociological features (Sector, L1–L3).
Final Phenomenon Identity (ID and Canonical Name) is determined exclusively by the Registry System. This framework MUST NOT generate or rename identities.
Do not guess. If a post is ambiguous, prioritize "Latent Function" over "Surface Content".

================================================================================
PART 1: SECTOR CLASSIFICATION LOGIC (The 5 Quadrants)
Map the post to ONE primary sector based on its dominant social function.
================================================================================

[SECTOR A] SYMBOLIC RESISTANCE (符號抵抗)
* Core Logic: Content that challenges power structures using "Hidden Transcripts" to evade censorship or retaliation.
* Primary Criteria:
  1. Target: Authority figures, policies, or dominant narratives.
  2. Tone: Playful, Ironic, Cynical (NOT just angry screaming).
  3. Mechanism: Metaphor (e.g., North Korea), Parody, Reclaiming symbols.
* Boundary Condition: If the post is purely angry without strategic rhetoric, classify as [SECTOR B].
* Example: Posting a North Korean passport to imply Hong Kong's lack of freedom.

[SECTOR B] COLLECTIVE TRAUMA (集體創傷)
* Core Logic: Processing a shared shock or loss through emotional expression.
* Primary Criteria:
  1. Trigger: A specific event (Fire, Accident, Arrest).
  2. Tone: High Arousal (Grief, Rage, Shock) or Depressive (Helplessness).
  3. Mechanism: Mourning rituals ("R.I.P."), Venting, calling for solidarity.
* Boundary Condition: If the mourning is used specifically to mock the government (e.g., "Mourning the death of logic"), classify as [SECTOR A].
* Example: "Seeing the fire makes me want to cry. God bless the victims."

[SECTOR C] DELEGITIMIZATION / CONSPIRACY (去合法化)
* Core Logic: Eroding the "Moral Authority" of the system by offering alternative (often irrational) explanations.
* Primary Criteria:
  1. Mechanism: "Muddling" (Supernatural explanations), "Demoralization" (It's all over/hopeless).
  2. Content: Feng Shui, Curses, Illuminati, attributing incompetence to malice/evil forces.
* Boundary Condition: Must involve a rejection of rational discourse.
* Example: "The snake array caused this fire, not the accident."

[SECTOR D] SANCTUARY OF NORMALCY (常態避難所)
* Core Logic: Maintaining social order and mental health through the performance of daily life.
* Primary Criteria:
  1. Content: Food, Family, Travel, Selfies, Hobbies.
  2. Function: "Social Stabilizer" - creating a safe zone away from political chaos.
  3. Tone: Joy, Calm, Neutral, Celebratory.
* Boundary Condition: If a food photo has a political caption (e.g., "Eating noodles while watching the gov collapse"), it is [SECTOR A], NOT [SECTOR D].
* Example: "Happy Birthday to me! Buffet with mom."

[SECTOR X] EMERGING PHENOMENA (新興現象)
* Core Logic: Detecting "Unknown Unknowns".
* Criteria:
  1. Does NOT fit A-D.
  2. Represents a new pattern (e.g., a specific new scam, a viral challenge, a new slang term).
* Action:
  Do NOT invent or propose a name.
  Instead, provide a detailed Phenomenological Description focusing on:
  - the core mechanism
  - the social intent
  - the symbolic or strategic function
  This description is interpretive evidence for the Registry and downstream analysis, not an identity.

================================================================================
PART 2: QUANTITATIVE SCORING RUBRIC (評分量表)
Use these specific markers to calculate scores. Do not estimate randomly.
================================================================================

1. CIVIL SCORE (1-10)
* Measure of: Constructiveness and adherence to social norms.
* Scoring Guide:
  - [1-3 (Toxic)]: Dehumanization (calling people animals/objects), curses, violent threats, doxxing.
  - [4-6 (Friction)]: Sarcasm, passive-aggressive debating, sharp criticism without insults, cynicism.
  - [7-8 (Neutral)]: Factual sharing, polite disagreement, standard social sharing.
  - [9-10 (Harmonious)]: Explicit praise, blessings ("Safe flight"), ritualistic bonding, high empathy.

2. HOMOGENEITY SCORE (0.0 - 1.0)
* Measure of: Echo Chamber effect vs. Dialectic Debate within the comments.
* Calculation Logic:
  - [0.0 - 0.3 (Conflict Zone)]: Comments are fighting. Mix of Likes and Dislikes. No dominant sentiment.
  - [0.4 - 0.7 (Discussion)]: Varied opinions but respectful. Or a mix of jokes and serious comments.
  - [0.8 - 1.0 (Echo Chamber/Ritual)]: Almost all comments say the same thing (e.g., "HBD", "Agree", "Rip").
* Usage: High score (0.9) often indicates [SECTOR D] (Ritual) or [SECTOR B] (Shared Grief). Low score often indicates a controversial topic.

3. STRATEGY INTENSITY (Low/Medium/High)
* Measure of: How heavily the post relies on L2 Strategies (e.g., Muddling, Normalization).
* Logic:
  - Low: Plain text, literal meaning.
  - High: Heavy use of metaphor, irony, or specific framing techniques defined in the Academic Theory.
